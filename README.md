# TSL/ITSL Online Learner

This is an implementation of the TSL grammar learner presented by Dakotah Lambert's 2021 "Grammar Interpretations and Learning TSL Online" (https://proceedings.mlr.press/v153/lambert21a/lambert21a.pdf),
as well as an implementation of a novel ITSL grammar learner based on the TSL learner algorithm.

The main implementations and some helper functions for usage are located in Lambert.py or the interactive Lambert.ipynb

Additionally, a script for testing the consistency of the grammars formed by this learner on several patterns are found in Aksenova.py (using the pipeline from AksÃ«nova 2020, found at https://www.proquest.com/docview/2436889255?pq-origsite=gscholar&fromopenview=true)


To run learning/generation, run:
    `bash test-learn.py`
To run evaluation of generated strings, run:
    `bash test-eval.py`
Note that this will take a long time to run, so you may wish to change the number of strings generated (`num_strings`), change the number of trials run, or select only certain learners/experiments (within test-learn.sh)
